Cryogenic Underground Test Facility software systems overhaul

## TODO
* Add a function to the plotting to only plot a portion of the data returned from the API call (like the spread function originally used)
* Try widen the PlottingInput bar a little bit
* Also try space out the drop down boxes a bit more
* Add a download functionality to the plotting page, once that's done remove the download tab
